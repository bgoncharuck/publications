I'm, unfortunately, a human. And, unfortunately, a human born in Ukraine.

I have lost too much due to war and the actions of my government.
This repository is my attempt to preserve some of my ideas and perspectives in case of my death.

While most of my ideas are expressed through Dart, C, and Shell code, I have decided to document some of them in text form.
