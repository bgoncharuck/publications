The Feudal Relationship Between Citizens and Governments

This feudal lord-serf relationship we have with our countries: where they own our passports, they really own our citizenship - we depend on them for our ability to go out in the world and escape them. It's a very circular logic.
Once you see the world for what it is, and see government officials and those who profit from them for the reality, rather than the rhetoric, it's very hard to go back.

The idea of borders is a myth, it's a fallacy. These lines on a map, which people treat as sacred, are arbitrary. They move, they change, and they exist in different forms. People place so much weight on them, despite having no say in where they are drawn. It's a form of indoctrination, a way to force allegiance to an illusion.
Defending these arbitrary lines wastes time, money, and resources. It restricts human freedom, fuels human trafficking, and increases expenses. Borders don’t exist to protect people; they exist to control them.

Most people don’t have an adventurous outlook on life. If you live in the same place your entire life, borders don’t affect you. But for those of us who want to explore, who want to live freely, the imposition is clear. Why should I have to beg some bureaucrat, pay fees, and justify my existence just to live in another place? Who is harmed by my movement?

Governments see their citizens as an investment, and something they own. They demand returns in the form of taxes, loyalty, war draft and obedience. And if you try to leave, they punish you for it.
Government is like a reverse casino, you give them hundreds of millions of dollars, and they say, ‘How dare you leave?’ 
Meanwhile, the official who contributes nothing is given all the benefits.
